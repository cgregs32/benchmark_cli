Benchmark is a CLI that tracks memory allocation and run times of ruby files.

For this project I will create a command line tool
  The tool will report benchmark data for the file that is run

  Cmd_line will accept a file 
  program will run and execute each method within the file
  program will return | method name | memory allocation | run times | ???

Next steps:
    enable this tool to be used within slack
    create UI to display as slackbot / message
